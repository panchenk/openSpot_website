							<h2>Scope of OnTheSpot Services</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>The OnTheSpot Platform is an online service which enables users to list and rent the use of parking spaces. Users must register with OnTheSpot to become Members. Members with access to parking spaces (“Lenders”) may list their information pertaining to parking spaces they are willing to provide. Other Members in need of parking services (“Renters”) can access the listings via the OnTheSpot Platform. OnTheSpot will facilitate scheduling and act as third party to facilitate payment by Renters to Lenders.
								</li>
								<li>OnTheSpot does not own, create, sell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any listings or Lender services. Lenders alone are responsible for their listings and accept sole responsibility for any liability stemming from their use of the OnTheSpot Platform, including, without limitation, misrepresentations, errors, or mistakes contained in or stemming from the listing of any parking spaces. OnTheSpot is no way a party to any contractual relationship which may arise between Lenders and Renters. OnTheSpot does not act as an agent for any party. OnTheSpot does not vouch for the credibility or good faith of any Member. OnTheSpot does not ensure the accuracy of any listing nor representation made by a Member. OnTheSpot does not engage in the resolution of disputes between Members. OnTheSpot does not have any control over the quality, safety, suitability, legality, or quality of services advertised in any listing.
								</li>
								<li>OnTheSpot may contain links to third-party websites and services. Each of these third- parties may have their own independent terms and services. You understand and agree that your use of any such third-party websites and services is contingent on your compliance with their terms of use. OnTheSpot is not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, quality, content, services, or products of any third-party. OnTheSpot does not endorse any third-party.
								</li>
								<li>
										OnTheSpot does not guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the Platform. OnTheSpot does not guarantee the security of any information provided on the Platform. Periodic outages may occur due to ongoing maintenance and Platform upgrades.

Should OnTheSpot terminate a Member’s account, OnTheSpot is not liable for any loss which is directly or indirectly related to that termination. BY CREATING A LISTING, LENDERS REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT THEY HAVE THE LEGAL CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES LISTED.

								<ol>
									<li>You and OnTheSpot mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the OnTheSpot’s Platform, the Lender Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”).

									<li>You and OnTheSpot each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</li>
									<li>You and OnTheSpot acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</li>
									<li>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. You and OnTheSpot acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and OnTheSpot both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

							</ol>
							<h2>Severability</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>In the event that any portion of this agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the agreement shall be given full force and effect.</li>
							</ol>
							You may not assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without OnTheSpot's prior written consent.
